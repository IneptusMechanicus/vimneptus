My personal neovim config, complete with colorscheme. It's somewhere in the middle of being just a personal config and a "distro". I believe the preinstalled packages are sufficient, though stuff like LSPs and Debuggers only span my personal scope. Keybindings are also not the most universal, they mostly follow my own logic.

## Requirements

### Base
* [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/latest) - The latest stable version
* [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) - I personally use FiraCode for regular and bold and Code New Roman for italic (since FiraCode doesn't have italics)

### Telescope
* [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - Telescope uses ripgrep as a dependency for Live Grep Searching through files. For Linux, it should be present in the default package repos.

### Debuggers
This config have an nvim-dap setups for PHP, Rust, GDScript and NVim Lua.
For further info on the setup and required packages, look at the [Debugger Adapter Installation Guide](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap/wiki/Debug-Adapter-installation) for `nvim-dap`

## Installation

Simply clone the repo into your nvim configuration folder.

#### Linux:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IneptusMechanicus/neovim-config.git .config/nvim
```
#### Windows

No clue. Who uses Neovim on Windows anyway?

#### MacOS

I've only ever touched an Apple device once. I think the setup is more or less similar to Linux, but don't quote me on that.

---

Once the download is complete, simply run Neovim. The config is written so that it will install all necessary plugins on first startup. The `alpha` dashboard won't appear until the next time you start neovim.
